# TITAN NO-REDIS QUICKSTART

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The Titan system now works **WITHOUT Redis** using file-based signal communication:

### Architecture Changes:
1. **Python Brain (`ml/brain.py`)**: Writes signals to `signals/outgoing/*.json`
2. **Node.js Bot (`offchain/execution/bot.js`)**: Monitors and processes signals from files
3. **Signal Flow**: `signals/outgoing/` → `signals/processed/`

### Files Modified:
- `ml/brain.py` - Removed Redis dependency, added JSON file writing
- `offchain/execution/bot.js` - Removed Redis subscription, added file watcher
- `mainnet_orchestrator.py` - Updated comments to reflect file-based signals
- `package.json` - Removed `redis` dependency
- `start_titan_integrated.bat` - New Windows launcher
- `start_titan_integrated.sh` - New Linux/Mac launcher
- `start_python_brain.bat` - Python-only launcher

---

## 🚀 How to Start the System

### Option 1: Integrated Launch (Recommended)
**Windows:**
```batch
start_titan_integrated.bat
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
chmod +x start_titan_integrated.sh
./start_titan_integrated.sh
```

This starts BOTH processes:
- Python Brain (finds opportunities)
- Node.js Bot (executes trades)

### Option 2: Manual Launch (Separate Terminals)

**Terminal 1 - Python Brain:**
```batch
python mainnet_orchestrator.py
```

**Terminal 2 - Node.js Bot:**
```batch
node offchain/execution/bot.js
```

## 📊 Verified Working

### Test Results:
✅ Node.js bot successfully started
✅ File watcher monitoring `signals/outgoing/`
✅ Test signal created and processed
✅ Paper trade executed:
   - Trade ID: PAPER-1
   - Token: WETH
   - Chain: Ethereum (1)
   - Expected Profit: $5.25
   - Status: SIMULATED

✅ Signal file moved to `signals/processed/`

## 🔍 How It Works

### Signal Generation (Python)
1. Brain finds arbitrage opportunity
2. Creates JSON signal file: `signals/outgoing/signal_{timestamp}_{token}.json`
3. File contains: token, chain, amount, DEX path, profit metrics

### Signal Processing (Node.js)
1. Watches `signals/outgoing/` every 1 second
2. Reads new JSON files
3. Executes trade (PAPER mode = simulated)
4. Moves file to `signals/processed/`

### Example Signal File:
```json
{
  "token_symbol": "WETH",
  "chainId": 1,
  "amount": "1000000000000000000",
  "dex_path": ["UNIV3", "SUSHI"],
  "metrics": {
    "profit_usd": 5.25,
    "roi": 1.05
  }
}
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### No Signals Generated?
- Check Python brain is running: `Get-Process python`
- Check for errors in console output
- Verify .env has valid RPC endpoints (Infura/Alchemy)

### Bot Not Processing Signals?
- Check Node.js bot is running: `Get-Process node`
- Verify `signals/outgoing/` directory exists
- Check console for file watcher confirmation

### Manual Test:
Create test signal:
```powershell
Copy-Item "signals\processed\signal_test_WETH.json" "signals\outgoing\"
```
Watch bot process it within 1 second.

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Verify Multi-Route Coverage**: Check if Python brain generates signals for all configured DEX routes (UNIV3→SUSHI, QUICKSWAP→SUSHI, etc.)

2. **Monitor Profit Metrics**: Ensure signals show expected $1.50-$10 profit range as advertised

3. **Test Live Chains**: Verify Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum are all generating opportunities

4. **Scale Testing**: Run for longer periods to validate 300+ scans/minute performance

## 📝 Configuration

### Execution Mode (.env):
```
EXECUTION_MODE=PAPER  # PAPER for simulation, LIVE for real trades
```

### Supported Chains:
- Ethereum (1)
- Polygon (137)
- Arbitrum (42161)
- Optimism (10)
- Base (8453)

### DEX Coverage:
- UniswapV3
- Sushiswap
- QuickSwap (Polygon)
- Camelot (Arbitrum)

## ✨ Benefits of No-Redis Architecture

✅ **Simpler Deployment** - No Redis server required
✅ **Easier Debugging** - Signals visible as JSON files
✅ **Better Persistence** - Signals saved to disk automatically
✅ **Cross-Platform** - Works identically on Windows/Linux/Mac
✅ **Audit Trail** - All processed signals archived in `signals/processed/`
