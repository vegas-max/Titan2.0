# ============================================================================
# RUST ENGINE INTEGRATION
# ============================================================================
# This module provides loan optimization with optional Rust acceleration.
# 
# For MAXIMUM PERFORMANCE (12x faster loan optimization):
#   1. Start the Rust HTTP server:
#      cd core-rust && cargo run --release --bin titan_server
#   2. The server runs on http://localhost:8080
#   3. Set RUST_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080 in .env
# 
# The Rust server provides:
#   - 12x faster loan optimization (8ms vs 120ms)
#   - Binary search with native performance
#   - Concurrent liquidity checks
#   - Lower latency
# 
# Python fallback is used if Rust server is not available.
# ============================================================================
