## Appendix

### A. Glossary

**MEV (Maximal Extractable Value):** Profit that can be extracted from blockchain transactions through reordering, inclusion, or exclusion.

**Sandwich Attack:** MEV strategy where a transaction is placed before (frontrun) and after (backrun) a target transaction to profit from price impact.

**JIT Liquidity:** Just-In-Time liquidity provision where liquidity is added immediately before a swap to capture fees, then removed.

**Merkle Batching:** Technique to batch multiple trades into a single transaction using Merkle trees for gas efficiency.

**Order Splitting:** Breaking large orders across multiple DEXes to minimize slippage.

**Bundle:** Group of transactions submitted together to be included in a specific order in a block.

**BloxRoute:** MEV infrastructure provider for private transaction submission and bundle delivery.
